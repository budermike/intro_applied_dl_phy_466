# PHY 466 — Introduction to Applied Deep Learning

This repository accompanies the module *Introduction to Applied Deep Learning*. It contains all materials from lectures, tutorials, as well as the three exam notebooks for the oral examination.



## Course Description

The course provides a practice-oriented introduction to Deep Learning, with a special focus on applications in natural sciences research. After an introduction to fundamental Machine Learning concepts, various types of deep neural networks are covered, including:

- Fully Connected Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Architectures for different learning strategies (supervised, unsupervised)

The course combines theoretical lectures with practical hands-on sessions and includes tutorials from invited experts.



## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of the module, participants should be able to:

- design and train suitable neural networks,
- solve tasks such as **classification**, **regression**, **clustering**, and **anomaly detection**,
- process various data types such as **images**, **sequences**, and **point clouds**,
- apply Deep Learning strategies in practical research applications.
